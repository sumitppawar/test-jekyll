<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Who am I???</h3>
<p>I'm Scala enthusiast with two years of commercial Scala experience (and counting). In these two years I've been working in Agile team on backend systems using Scala, Akka, Spray and other technologies where everything were deployed to AWS. Along this time I've also done some significant UI work using Angular.js and Play Framework. I'm regular attendee of London Scala Users' Group events.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in other functional languages like Haskell or Lisp, but this doesn't mean that I've never done OO programming before.</p>
